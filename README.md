# Overview

This is the start of a web app that I am writing using the Django framework and python to increase my experience and skill as a software engineer. 

The app that I am writing is a bank ledger. This app is supposed to help you keep track of your finances like a budget would. TO run this app you simply have to make sure you have django and 
python installed on your machine and then run 'py manage.py runserver'. Then you ctrl+click on the link that pops up and navigate to .../bankaccount/ then you will be brough to the first
page of the app.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

{Describe each of the web pages you created and how the web app transitions between each of them.  Also describe what is dynamically created on each page.}

# Development Environment

I also used the python programmming language, specfically python 3.9+
